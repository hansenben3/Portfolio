                    After graduating highschool in 2019 I worked at Best Buy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My girlfriend started school in Kansas so I moved in with her and started working at Sprint and T-Mobile as a sales associate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After moving back home from Kansas I decided that I was gonna act on my desire to become a software engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm looking to become a software engineer for two reasons.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create something bigger then myself.
                        </li>

                    <strong>I would like to look more into the game development side of the coding industry as well.</strong>
